Also information like the use of helmets and seat belts to avoid major injuries in case of accidents, the proper way to use road signs/traffic signs to prevent rush and grave major accidents, types of road signs like mandatory signs, informative signs, etc. Detailed information about highway hypnosis which is still a foreign concept to many was also explained. Later on, a beautiful felicitation ceremony took place. Then the students were guided by Mrs. Rupali Kamble Mam. She briefed us about how one can use these rules and safety precautionary measures. She informed us about the number of accidents happening every year and the number is definitely a huge one. A major amount of accidents are happening due to alcoholism. She also explained the purpose of symbols instead of words is for guidance on road for illiterate people. The information shared by her was very valuable.</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/20230117_174229-1.jpg\" data-size=\"448x584\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/20230117_174229-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"584\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/PXL_20230117_174417379.PORTRAIT.jpg\" data-size=\"443x591\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/PXL_20230117_174417379.PORTRAIT-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"591\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By wishing us a safe and bright future she ended her speech. A campaign “Walk on Right” which states beautifully how one must walk on the right side of the road for their safety that recently took place in Nanded was also shown. Mr. Shailesh Kamat Sir shared some more information about safety measures that one must follow while being on road. A few wise words shared by him were, “In road safety, there are mainly four E’s which are important; Education, Enforcement, Engineering, and Emergency Care.” He explained and told us how these four E’s are important for every individual who uses the road as a means of transport. He also said, “If we follow safety rules then we can safe ourselves from serious and major accidents”, he gave an example of how one famous businessman Mr. Cyrus Mistry lost his life in a car accident for not wearing a seat belt. All the students were further guided by Mr. Avinash Kumar about road safety. While sharing his opinions about road safety he also told us about his engineering days and a few memories related to it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least our respected director sir shared his experience and knowledge while also stating mandatory rules like one must wear a helmet if riding a two-wheeler on college premises. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire ceremony was concluded in a grand manner by singing National Anthem.</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/PXL_20230117_172343140.PORTRAIT.jpg\" data-size=\"443x591\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/PXL_20230117_172343140.PORTRAIT-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"591\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/PXL_20230117_181228447.PORTRAIT.jpg\" data-size=\"443x591\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/PXL_20230117_181228447.PORTRAIT-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"591\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/Screenshot-2023-01-19-212145.jpg\" data-size=\"313x451\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/Screenshot-2023-01-19-212145-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"313\" height=\"451\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/Untitled-design-2.jpg\" data-size=\"430x608\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/17/gallery/Untitled-design-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"608\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these delegates removed some of their precious time and guided us.

Still in their 40s they had such great energy and enthusiasm. They had lunch and after that they had a bonfire and they enjoyed very well. On the next day 24 December from 09:00 am to 12:00 pm they had a sports bonanza along with breakfast on the sports ground. They had many events and literally they enjoyed each and every part of the event. And at last from 2:30 pm they had a visit to Kaleshwar temple and Gurudwara.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall it was a great event and we all had so much fun!!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>",
