<p>They said that the college has major changes. And they shared how the college helped them to build and how they are successful in their life till now. They had a very good conversation with us. Their memories had so many emotions filled with love , immense joy and fun. And they said those three four years were the best part of their life and having fun with friends was one of the major and the best part. In their time they used to have a ‘ Dev mama canteen ‘ in the college and one tree hill point  that was the place where they used to hangout and chill with friends. The alumni shared their college memories, mentioning the changes in the college campus, facilities, and atmosphere. They were really impressed to see the infrastructure and greenery of the campus. Speaking about earlier facilities they told us that the labs and libraries were available 24x7 that helped them to learn and explore. This is one of the reasons that pushed them up in their life. When asked about the college events they mentioned the Khojagiri Poornima used to be celebrated above the rooftops of their departments overnight. They also mentioned about the earthquake that took place. </p>

<p>They shared so much about their life after and before SGGS . We had a cultural program from 7 pm onwards. It was so much and they enjoyed it a lot . They danced and many of them were singing songs . It was great to listen to them and see them enjoying . Still in their 40s they had such great energy and enthusiasm. They had lunch and after that they had a bonfire and they enjoyed very well. On the next day 24 December from 09:00 am to 12:00 pm they had a sports bonanza along with breakfast on the sports ground. They had many events and literally they enjoyed each and every part of the event. And at last from 2:30 pm they had a visit to Kaleshwar temple and Gurudwara.</p>
