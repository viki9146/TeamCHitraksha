So, team RNXG also tried to recreate that ambience again through Rmegaddon by keeping the theme 'Retro Gaming'.</strong></p>\n<h4 class=\"align-center\">DAY 1</h4>\n<p>The day started with inauguration of event by the hands of faculty coordinator Dr.M.V. Bhalerao in the presence of all the faculty members and revealing the theme for the very first game i.e. Retromania (Roborace).</p>\n<p>Let me ask you a question, what do you think could be the theme?? ( Hint: Which video game was played by most people in their childhood??) Yes, it's Mario and the Retromania was based on it and the way arena was printed and obstacles were set up, it gave us the complete nostalgia!! The event was hosted well by the commentators Nikhilesh Deshmukh, Prasad Chede and Atharva Jagdale.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_0780.JPG\" data-size=\"627x418\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_0780-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"627\" height=\"418\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_0783.JPG\" data-size=\"627x418\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_0783-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"627\" height=\"418\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_1029.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_1029-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_1010.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://teamchitraksha.tech/media/posts/29/gallery/DSC_1010-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Some teams managed to cross all the obstacle that too within times and some unfortunately weren't able to complete it but you know learning is more important rather than winning.
