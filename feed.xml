                <p class="align-left">Team Drishti organized one of the most amazing events of our institute, which was Face Painting🤩. Every face was not only filled with colors but with characters that had a story to tell!!</p>

<p class="align-left">Some were roaming with their horror faces and some with cutely painted faces but I think everyone's favorite was the one who carried 'The boys' tag and who doesn't love music, not just that but enjoying the music along with painting, artists know that that's why they created a vibe that people will not only love but will remember. 💝<br>Not everyone participated but was too interested to get their faces painted, so some drew tattoos on their faces. 🤭</p>
<p><strong>Winners are not those who do things best than anyone else but who do things uniquely!!</strong></p>
<p>Winners for the event were Manthan Khose, Chaitanya Panchal, and Bhagyashree Narwadkar, how amazing they created that messed face painting.. followed by Pranoti Dhone, Swati Wankhade, Gunjan Dadhiwale who were the 1st runner ups and the 2nd runner ups were the freshers Rajlaxmi Watgule, Vipakshi Mate, Ashutosh Hamand. </p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 17/01/23 we had a road safety program arranged in our college, the program initially focused on how we need to take safety measures to avoid major and severe accidents. The chief guests of this program were Mr. Avinash Kumar Sir(post-upper superintendent of police, Nanded); the honorable Mr.Shailesh Kamat Sir.</span></p>

</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program started with instructions on rules and regulations and some important information about basic symbols that one must know before using the road as a means of transport, like “We should always walk on the right side of the road”, “If in case the indicators of our respective vehicle are not working properly then we should use specific hand gestures”. Also information like the use of helmets and seat belts to avoid major injuries in case of accidents, the proper way to use road signs/traffic signs to prevent rush and grave major accidents, types of road signs like mandatory signs, informative signs, etc. Detailed information about highway hypnosis which is still a foreign concept to many was also explained. Later on, a beautiful felicitation ceremony took place. Then the students were guided by Mrs. Rupali Kamble Mam. She briefed us about how one can use these rules and safety precautionary measures. She informed us about the number of accidents happening every year and the number is definitely a huge one. A major amount of accidents are happening due to alcoholism. She also explained the purpose of symbols instead of words is for guidance on road for illiterate people. The information shared by her was very valuable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By wishing us a safe and bright future she ended her speech. A campaign “Walk on Right” which states beautifully how one must walk on the right side of the road for their safety that recently took place in Nanded was also shown. Mr. Shailesh Kamat Sir shared some more information about safety measures that one must follow while being on road. A few wise words shared by him were, “In road safety, there are mainly four E’s which are important; Education, Enforcement, Engineering, and Emergency Care.” He explained and told us how these four E’s are important for every individual who uses the road as a means of transport. He also said, “If we follow safety rules then we can safe ourselves from serious and major accidents”, he gave an example of how one famous businessman Mr. Cyrus Mistry lost his life in a car accident for not wearing a seat belt. All the students were further guided by Mr. Avinash Kumar about road safety. While sharing his opinions about road safety he also told us about his engineering days and a few memories related to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least our respected director sir shared his experience and knowledge while also stating mandatory rules like one must wear a helmet if riding a two-wheeler on college premises. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire ceremony was concluded in a grand manner by singing National Anthem.</span></p>

</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these delegates removed some of their precious time and guided us. Their efforts for the safety of citizens were really felt as the information shared by them was brief yet covered all the important points related to road safety. Last but not least-</span></p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>“The future of the road safety movement is not much dependent upon the invention of safety devices as on the improvement of methods of             educating people to the ideal of caution and safety.” </strong></p>

<p>They said that the college has major changes. And they shared how the college helped them to build and how they are successful in their life till now. They had a very good conversation with us. Their memories had so many emotions filled with love , immense joy and fun. And they said those three four years were the best part of their life and having fun with friends was one of the major and the best part. In their time they used to have a ‘ Dev mama canteen ‘ in the college and one tree hill point  that was the place where they used to hangout and chill with friends. The alumni shared their college memories, mentioning the changes in the college campus, facilities, and atmosphere. They were really impressed to see the infrastructure and greenery of the campus. Speaking about earlier facilities they told us that the labs and libraries were available 24x7 that helped them to learn and explore. This is one of the reasons that pushed them up in their life. When asked about the college events they mentioned the Khojagiri Poornima used to be celebrated above the rooftops of their departments overnight. They also mentioned about the earthquake that took place. </p>

<p>They shared so much about their life after and before SGGS . We had a cultural program from 7 pm onwards. It was so much and they enjoyed it a lot . They danced and many of them were singing songs . It was great to listen to them and see them enjoying . Still in their 40s they had such great energy and enthusiasm. They had lunch and after that they had a bonfire and they enjoyed very well. On the next day 24 December from 09:00 am to 12:00 pm they had a sports bonanza along with breakfast on the sports ground. They had many events and literally they enjoyed each and every part of the event. And at last from 2:30 pm they had a visit to Kaleshwar temple and Gurudwara.</p>
<p><strong>Overall it was a great event and we all had so much fun!!</strong></p>
