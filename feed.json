Also information like the use of helmets and seat belts to avoid major injuries in case of accidents, the proper way to use road signs/traffic signs to prevent rush and grave major accidents, types of road signs like mandatory signs, informative signs, etc. Detailed information about highway hypnosis which is still a foreign concept to many was also explained.

She informed us about the number of accidents happening every year and the number is definitely a huge one. A major amount of accidents are happening due to alcoholism.

He also said, “If we follow safety rules then we can safe ourselves from serious and major accidents”, he gave an example of how one famous businessman Mr. Cyrus Mistry lost his life in a car accident for not wearing a seat belt.
